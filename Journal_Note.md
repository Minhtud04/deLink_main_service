# Checkpoint 2:
•	Profile and Request Forms: I will navigate through the application to demonstrate the forms for creating user profiles (for both students and alumni). I will then show a logged-in student filling out and submitting a "Quick Coffee Chat" request. I will confirm its success by showing the newly created request associated with that student in the database

•	Algorithms: I will demonstrate the algorithms in a raw way, giving the input and showing the output, but no integration in the system.

Breakdown:
1. Request creation API
2. User info creation API
3.
